Everything is a system.

First, let's define what a system is. A system is a group of interconnected parts that form a whole, functioning together toward a specific purpose.

For examples of systems, you have macro systems like the global economy and climate, everyday systems like a car, a house, or a computer, and micro systems like a cellular system or a computer circuit. 

If we were to define a system as an equation, it might look something like this:

System output = f(inputs, parts, interactions)

A system always has its parts, its whole, and the function.

Everything is a system. From the atom to the t-shirt you're wearing.

Parts: nucleus, protons, electrons \
Whole: Atom \
Function: The building block of matter

T-Shirt
