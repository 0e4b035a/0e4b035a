## Who

Hello, I am 0e4b035a but if we are close you can call me **L**

Chief Cyborg Engineer expressing ideas wrt technology. **SUBJECT TO CHANGE**

## Why 

I decided to create this data feed for a few reasons:

1. To share my journey as CCE (Chief Cyborg Engineer)
2. To document my work - code, thoughts, and projects. 
3. To connect with like-minded individuals 

## What 

In the coming tranmissions, you can expect to learn:

- Projects I'm working on or interested in
- Explorations in Artificial Intelligence, Brain-Computer Interfaces, and Robotics
- Thoughts on Software, Code, and Deep Tech 

## Where

Station x0e,  adrift in a stranger's galaxy

## Code

I am a Chief Cyborg Engineer, it would be remiss of me not to include a bit of code in my first upload. 

```go
func gen0e4b035a() string {
	chars := "0123456789abcdef"
	return string([]rune{rune(chars[0]), rune(chars[14]), rune(chars[4]), rune(chars[11]), rune(chars[0]), rune(chars[3]), rune(chars[5]), rune(chars[10])})
}
```

## End 

Until next time, happy hacking!
